File List:
BM.java - Original Boyer-Moore algorithm using good suffix and bad character rule
BioOverlap.java - "True" solution suggested in email to find overlap in nucleotides
Combine.java - Combines sets of FASTA/GFF files. Files needed by our group hardcoded
               into the source code for ease of use.
TestBM.java - Tests the Boyer-Moore algorithm
fasta/ - FASTA files for contig 20-38* and fosmid 22-42 
gff/ - GFF files for contig 20-38* and fosmid 22-42
*missing gff 23, thus the extra gap that will show up in our output

To compile: 
-"make" or "javac *.java"

To run:
-Boyer-Moore Tests, "make test" or "java TestBM"
-File Combination, "make combine" or "java Combine"

Output:
-superFASTA#.txt and superGFF#.txt
-variations#.csv - all variations
# = splits when there are gaps in files
