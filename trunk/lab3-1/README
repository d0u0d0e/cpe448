File List:
BM.java - Original Boyer-Moore algorithm using good suffix and bad character rule
BioOverlap.java - "True" solution suggested in email to find overlap in nucleotides
Isoform.java - Represents an Isoform with mRNA/CDS
Combine.java - Combines sets of FASTA/GFF files. Files needed by our group hardcoded
               into the source code for ease of use.
TestBM.java - Tests the Boyer-Moore algorithm
fasta/ - FASTA files for contig 20-38* and fosmid 22-42 
gff/ - GFF files for contig 20-38* and fosmid 22-42
***missing GFF 23, thus the extra gap that will show up in our output

To compile: 
-"make" or "javac *.java"

To run:
-Boyer-Moore Tests, "make test" or "java TestBM"
-Type "java Combine <chromosome> <start> <stop>" to merge the files.
  example1: to merge fosmid 22-24 use "java Combine f 20 24"
  example2: to merge contig 20-30 use "java Combine c 20 30"
  note: max range for contig is 20-38 and fosmid is 22-42

Output:
-superFASTA#.txt and superGFF#.txt
-variations#.csv - all variations
# = splits when there are gaps in files

Note: In the contigs/fosmids our BIO partners were assigned
      to (contig 20-38, fosmid 22-42), no variations were 
      found (confirmed with BLAST), thus the variations.csv 
      remain empty. But to test that our code still checks for
      them, the GFF files can be modified. i.e. remove a CDS 
      line or change the CDS ranges
